# Node Camouflage

Run these simple scripts to show/hide files on your Desktop without actually deleting or moving the files. Works on Mac / Linux. I am planning on implementing a simple GUI to make this more convenient for actual users. Right now, think of it as a simple experiment.

This is still in development, so all of the necessary files can be found on the `dev` branch.

### hide

```
$ node hide.js
```

### show

```
$ node unhide.js
```

Depending on which version of Node you are using you may need to use the harmony flag:

### hide

```
$ node --harmony hide.js
```

###show

```
$ node --harmony unhide.js
```
